Dear Recruiting Team,

Every once in a while you discover words written in print that speak to you. Ever since I discovered Gitlab's Handbook online, I pull it out frequently in 1-1s with my team, executive meetings, and even at home. I find them to be well-articulated, cogent, and identify with the values wholeheartedly. I've been a huge proponent of Agile (both with a capital and small "A") my whole career and firmly believe all teams can use the continuous improvement cycle to grow and excel. 

I'm passionate about open source, enablement tooling, metrics, and operations. My current team are building a machine learning platform based upon Kubernetes, Contour, and what we call "inference units". 

I hope you find it worth reviewing both this note and my LinkedIn profile so we might have a further conversation about the role.

Many thanks,
David
