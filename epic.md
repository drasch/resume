Dear Recruiting Team and Hiring Manager,

I'm motivated by learning and creating products people love to use. I love Epic
Games's mission and I especially connect with the idea of "building tools ...
we need to bring those games to life". My whole career has been about bringing
products and ideas to life while working with great people helping people grow
their careers to do the same.

I'm super excited to connect with the team to discuss how things work now at
Epic and the challenges this position will help to solve.

My passion for open-source, enablement tooling, metrics, scalability, and
operations started early in my career and never stopped whether it's sending
billions of emails or text messages, to helping music artists publish their
songs, to helping analyze the nuances of pre-teens text messages to understand
changes in their mental health.

My kids are super excited even hearing about this opportunity to work with
people creating games they've played. I appreciate your consideration.

Many thanks,  
David Rasch
