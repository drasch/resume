Dear Recruiting Team,

Every once in a while you find a company who's values and product speak to you. As with all values, it's easy to say you should put "users first," but the details of how to live this value are where all the talented and hardworking leaders at a company help to define what the meaning really is. I always work to help live the values as I work with teams, peers, my managers to and leverage the words to tie discussions together.  I pull them out frequently in 1-1s with my team, executive meetings, and even at home. I've been a huge proponent of Agile (both with a capital and small "A") my whole career and firmly believe all teams can use the continuous improvement cycle to grow and excel. 

I'm passionate about open source, enablement tooling, metrics, and operations. My current team are building a machine learning platform based upon Kubernetes, Contour, and what we call "inference units". 

In my history, I spent a lot of time both at iContact and ReverbNation working on thier "billing systems" and "subscription management" aspects of their product. This is often a lonely task, yet I find a lot of passion, problem solving, and pride in making sure these aspects of the software serve both the developers and all the teams who use them from Finance, to Customer Support, and Fraud Prevention.

I hope you find it worth reviewing both this note and my resume and/or LinkedIn profile so we might have a further conversation about the role.

Many thanks,
David
