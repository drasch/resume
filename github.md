Dear Recruiting Team and Hiring Manager,

I'm motivated by learning and creating products people love to use. I feel like
I've lived my whole life aligning with Github's values of the power of a
diverse community to help create products to improve our world. I love to
help engineering teams live the values by turning them into a daily opportunity
for storytelling and alignment. The better a team understands where we're going
and why the easier it is to lead them to success.

My passion for open-source, enablement tooling, metrics, scalability, and
operations started early in my career and never stopped whether it's sending
billions of emails or text messages, to helping music artists publish their
songs, to helping analyze the nuances of pre-teens text messages to understand
changes in their mental health.

I'm very excited to start the discussion about how I can bring my skills of
leadership to the challenges of Github's Engineering Operations team.

Many thanks,  
David Rasch
