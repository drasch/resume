Dear Recruiting Team and Hiring Manager,

I'm motivated by learning and creating products people love to use. I feel like
I've lived my whole life aligning with Datadog's values enthusiasm, humility,
and openness. I also love to help engineering teams live the values by turning
them into a daily opportunity for storytelling and alignment. The better a team
understands where we're going and why the easier it is to lead them to success.

My passion for open-source, enablement tooling, metrics, scalability, and
operations started early in my career and never stopped whether it's sending
billions of emails or text messages, to helping music artists publish their
songs, to helping analyze the nuances of pre-teens text messages to understand
changes in their mental health.

I'm very excited to start the discussion about how I can bring my skills of
leadership to the challenges of Datadog's compute team.

Many thanks,  
David Rasch
